                  <p>Mock Ram</p>
                 <p>This piece is a satire of car commercials, both print and video. This was my first introduction to marketing through graphic design. During my first Digital Arts final, I chose to make a mock RAM advertisement that would showcase the skills I had developed during that semester. This significance in this piece lies in how early in my studies I had completed it, and the significant amount of work put into creating something I would focus on for the rest of my undergraduate career. Taking inspiration from other RAM advertisements, I took stock nature photos and a cut out of a RAM Truck to combine to my liking. The image trace on Adobe Illustrator was one of my most utilized resources. The tool allowed me to use and change transparent photos after they had been vectorized while not having to worry about a loss in quality if there were sizes to change. Photoshop allowed me to easily change the selection and color of the background. The focus was to make the advertisement look as though it had been printed with a vibrant, cartoonish style with country appeal. I wanted someone to mistake my advertisement for a real RAM advertisement. Having limited experience with cars, the information text is a parody of what I would hear in television automobile advertisements. 
In hindsight there could have been much more work placed into the details of the background and the shape of the truck. Being so focused on the big picture makes the small details slip through.
The quality and time put into this piece makes the efforts put towards improving feel worthwhile. I am aware that I could design something along these lines in a much faster time in present-day, but understanding that if this was my best three years ago, my best now can be exponentially better. </p>

                  <p>Architecture of Orlando | See the full series at https://flic.kr/s/aHskquwLt4</p>
                  <p>Driving along the interstate, I came along a business park and thought about taking my camera for a closer look. Focused on symmetry, color, and unseen architecture in the Orlando area, this project became a goal. People had been to this park previously, but had never stopped to look at what was there from an artistic perspective. I then left and traveled downtown where I continued taking photos of buildings and skyscrapers. Something amusing about the piece was that those two photos were said by others to be my strongest photos throughout the collection, when I felt they were the weakest.
The use of angles and post-processing were something I both enjoyed and did well in, and I continue to feel this almost two years later. The patterns in the buildings were used to my advantage, and are still visually interesting. On the other hand, I could have searched harder for something more visually interesting, rather than patterns on a building. It would have been great to have seen this through instead of rushing for a final product.
This piece helped me frame my future photography as something that shouldn't be rushed. It has also helped me identify moments where I have to take a photo, or moments that deserve a spur-of-the-moment photoshoot. Going on a drive, stopping somewhere, and deciding to see what there is to find is something I enjoy doing now when I have some time off. Observing the structure and architecture of buildings passed by many have contributed to my personal aesthetic. The clean, cool colors of the downtown can be seen in my designs and photography currently, and they are likely to stay.</p>

                  <p>Tied Back</p>
                  <p>
This piece was photographed and primarily digitally manipulated in Photoshop. Disembodied legs wrapped in white, rugged, and rough ropes, the legs are painted black and the background was darkened in order to hide the model's body. The concept as a whole was representative of unrealistic standards within society and media towards women and their bodies. The ropes are the physical representation of what is holding back women, meant to look old and unpleasant in contrast to the polished legs.
The manual work in painting my legs and dabbing the rope in white paint was a process in prep that I did not enjoy, but feel I did well. Smoothing the legs was not perfect as well as enhancing the white rope to get rid of imperfections along the twinges and edges of the rope when editing.
Doing more in the studio while setting up the background for the photo would have been helpful to leaven the post-production process. 
After its completion I was able to take a step back and understand that the process of creating a design, whether it be graphic or some sort of digital manipulation, requires thought, practice, perseverance, and the ability to work with what you've got. This also includes making sure that there isn't a singular try to make at completing a project. This was done in one shoot over the course of about an hour and a half. It was worth the work, but frustrating to edit. Scrapping a project and redoing it from a different perspective has lead me to make work I am proud of, no matter how much I may have enjoyed the first try.</p>

                 <p>Student Success</p>
                  <p>The Academic Success Center at Stetson was looking for a new poster for their Success Coaching service. This was an opportunity to go outside of my comfort zone when designing and have my work shown to a wider audience. One of the most notable stages of this poster was how my first design was nothing like the final product. Originally, the design consisted of many circles that moved upwards and varied in size and color. Receiving feedback on the previous design forced me to rethink how I was looking at the objective and purpose of the Academic Success Center’s needs. The blue, cold tones are meant to be inviting and non-threatening, while the mountain is a metaphorical approach on success. With the help of the Student Success Center, the student, helped by the Center’s employees, can climb this mountain with more ease. One of the most challenging parts of designing this poster was figuring out what was going to symbolize the path to success. There were multiple ideas that included a yellow brick road,  a basic banner, and people holding hands. I settled on a polygonal mountain because of how customizable the mountain could be, and how the polygons blend well with the cold tones of the overall poster design. If I did make this poster again, I would change how some of the text is oriented in order to match the rugged sides of the mountain. From what has been posted around campus I can safely say mine was not chosen, but I am very satisfied with the results of this piece. The process has made me more comfortable working with poster advertisement design.</p>

                 <p>Sunday Soul Brunch Sponsorship Packet</p>
                   <p>
Sunday Soul Brunch is the largest event put on by Collective Church. To obtain more funding and pursue partnership with local DeLand businesses, I was asked to design a Sponsorship Packet. The packet must have been strictly within Collective Church and Sunday Soul Brunch branding standards. Conveying Collective's personality and business needs at once was a challenge, and making sure that each page would be consistent and appealing was my top priority. The color scheme given by the Sunday Soul Brunch logo and website was enough to provide a starting point, and I spent inside and outside of my internship hours thinking and drafting different templates for the packet. The importance of a consistent and appropriate design was on my mind, and to accomplish this I made sure that there was no unnecessary white/negative space on the packet. Each page was made to hold different, but important information. The process was rough and getting constant feedback on elements I had overlooked became frustrating. Without this feedback, it would not have been a success, and looking back I could have taken more time to fine-tune my work for a smoother production. Overall, this is my most proud work, and dedicating significant time to designing it made the moment it was approved, printed, and distributed one of the best thus far.</p>

                 <p>Hand Art Center Brochure and Bookmark</p>
                   <p>
I had the opportunity to work with a small group of my peers and create promotional material for Stetson Unviersity's Hand Art Center and their Oscar Bluember 150th Birthday event. The plan was to create primarily print material and adjust file formats accordingly for digital use. I decided to be in charge of creating a brochure and a bookmark that could be handed out at the Hand Art Center as well as local businesses with brochure boxes. Originally, the brochure was orange, filled with cuts and shaped of artwork, and would have to be edited by one of the Hand Art Center employees whenever there would be a new exhibit. After meeting with Tonya, the art gallery's curator, I and my group members found out that altering photos of art by Oscar Bluemner, especially art that is not owned by Stetson, should be avoided. This changed my mindset significantly, and lead to some distress over what kind of design I needed due to my original being scrapped. It was disheartening to have to start over, but it forced me to look at the brochure from a simpler, more effective standpoint. As a result the brochure is a static image and text with the most important basic information about the center's hours, parking, and contact. The photo chosen as the backdrop was a deep blue sea, overlooked by a building. The photo gave me room to insert information, and I believed the integrity of the art was not sacrificed for the sake of advertising. The same design was applied to the bookmark, and was approved. While I put a lot of dedication into the first design it was a learning experience to work around the idea of a static brochure. Less can be more.   </p>
